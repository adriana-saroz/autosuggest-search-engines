Autosuggest Search Engines
==========================


Project Proposal
----------------
The Firefox search bar provides the ability to add a website as a search engine, while visiting a website that complies to the OpenSearch standard. Although most websites offer search functionalities, only few present themselves as OpenSearch capable.
This project aims at adding to Firefox the ability to detect repeatedly used search fields and suggest websites as being search capable. The result from an user experience point of view will be seeing an entry with "Add <website>" under the search engines list in the search bar. By choosing to add the suggested entry, users will be able to query a detected search field without having to first visit the source website.

The detection will take place when the user submits a query through a form. The form will be validated against a set of criterias in order to decide if that form has the characteristics of a search form or not. I have split the design/implementation of the algorithm into two phases. 

Phase 1 is a simple set of yes/no criterias that decide whether a form qualifies or not. The set of criterias is the following:
The following should occur for the form to be considered a candidate:

* The form contains one visible input of type search or text.
* Note that the form may contain one or more inputs of type hidden.
* The form method is get or post.
* The form may contain inputs of type combo, only if these have a default value.

Any of the following exclude the form from being a candidate:

* The site is already added to the list of managed search engines.
* The form contains more than one visible input of type search or text. (probably registration form or survey)
* The form contains at least one input of type password. (probably login form)
* The form contains at least one input of type email. (probably registration form)
* The form contains at least one input of type file. (probably file upload. There exist image based search engines, but this is a special case that I would not handle as part of GSoC)
* The form contains a visible textarea (probably blogs, status, comments)

Hypothesis testing of the algorithm  

* Facebook.  
    * Use Cases that qualify:  
        * The search form in the header qualifies.  
    * Use Cases that do not qualify:
         * The login form on the front page does not qualify because the password input is of type password.
         * The sign up form on the front page does not qualify for several reasons: it contains inputs of type password, it contains more than one input of type text.
         * The Update Status form contains an input of type text for tagging people (who-are-you-with) but it also contains a textarea
         * The comments sections contain textareas.  

* Reddit  
     * Use Cases that qualify:
         * The search form has one single text input and does not contain unallowed elements.  
     * Use Cases that do not qualify:  
         * The login form right below the search form.

The problem with phase 1, is that any form that contains only one input of type text and no other elements, would qualify. For example, the pbs portal (www.pbs.org) has a search form in the header, but it also has a subscription form (with input type text). Both forms would qualify against the above criteria. Now, in this particular case a user would probably not use the subscription form more than one time, but this example proves the flaw of the above algorithm.

Which is why, for phase two I would enhance the above algorithm by adding a ranking mechanism. All of the above arguments remain valid and they will be assigned with corresponding positive/negative weights. Additionally, I would add weights to the following factors:

* Positive weight if the input with type text has onkeyup/onkeydown event handlers. They might indicate the presence of incremental search or real-time suggestions.
* Positive weight if the input, the form or any of the intermediary html elements have ids/classes/titles that contain the word "search". This can also be extended by adding common international equivalences of the word "search". Note that not meeting this criteria would not reduce the rank of a candidate form.
* Positive weight if the absolute position of the form is smaller than some threshold, thus indicating that the form might be part of the header of the website (most search fields are part of headers).


Schedule of Deliverables
------------------------
Between the time Google announces the list of accepted students and until the final evaluation submission date, there is a work period of 17 weeks. I will be attending classes and have my thesis due by the 3rd of July, so I would be able to work about 2 hours/day until then, and full time after that as I have no other commitment.

I estimate my project schedule to be the following:

* May 25 - June 16 (3 weeks): Getting to know the community, discussing the project details with the mentor, studying the code base.
* June 17 - July 6 (4 weeks): Implementing the simple algorithm described for phase 1 and testing it against a larger number of websites. Also writing some simple tests to validate the algorithm. Up until this point I would be working in paralel with my thesis which is why I have reserved full 4 weeks for this part.
* July 7 - July 28 (2 weeks): Changing the form history database structure to add the website URL and any other data that might be needed. Hooking up the form detection with the UI: adding an entry with "Add <website>" under the search engines list in the search bar.
* Mid-term deliverable: A working version of the simplified search field detection algorithm.
* July 29 - August 18 (3 weeks): Implementing the extended algorithm described for phase 2.
* August 19 - Sept 8 (3 weeks): Writing tests for the extended detection.
* Sept 9 - Sept 22 (2 weeks): Code cleanup and improving documentation.

A stretch goal in case everything works ahead of schedule is to discuss any necessary UX improvements with the mentor and proceed with implementing the discussed changes during or after GSoC.


Open Source Development Experience
----------------------------------
While working on a web application based on the SproutCore framework (http://sproutcore.com/), I have reported several bugs. I have also brought improvements to the version that we had forked at the time (about 2 years ago). The most significant ones were increasing the accuracy of gestures recognition when dealing with swipe and scroll simultaneously and improving the algorithm used for recognising the user agent.


Work/Internship Experience
--------------------------
I have recently left my job as a software developer for 3 Pillar Global (https://www.3pillarglobal.com/) in order to finish my master's degree and devote some time to other projects like GSoC. During the two and a half years that Iâ€™ve spent there I worked in the context of web and native mobile development. I was part of three major projects and teams, and I also switched between different technologies: JavaScript, Python and Android. I have a few months worth of JavaScript work experience as part of the UI team for a news publishing web application, based on SproutCore and I have done both frontend and backend work for the mobile website of the PBS video portal and other PBS products. I also worked as an intern for TBA (http://www.tba.nl/), where I developed a 3D driver application that works synchronised to Google Earth and allows viewing replays of different large scale simulations.


Academic Experience
-------------------
I graduated with a Bachelor degree in Computer Science at the Babes Bolyai University in Cluj Napoca, Romania (http://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/en/), in 2011, where I was ranked 9/150. I am currently pursuing a masters program in Distributed Systems at the same university. I am working on my last courses and my thesis and I'm expected to graduate in July.


Why Me
------
I already have hands-on experience with the technologies needed in order to complete this project. I have worked with JavaScript before, also with databases in general and SQLite in particular while developing on Android. I am familiar with joining a large team and a project with a very large code base as I have done this two times in the past and I am very excited by the prospect of digging through a huge JavaScript codebase and adding features to it.
